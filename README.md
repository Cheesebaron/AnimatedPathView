AnimatedPathView
================

Port of [Matt Kula's][matt] [AnimatedPathView][anim] to Xarain.Android with some extras allowing the view using simple SVG paths.

What does it do?
================

It animates a path! Take a look at [this blog post][guyb] [Romain Guy][guy] posted, which idea this sprung from. There is a nice video in that post.

Basically it takes a path, and over time it fills that path out on the screen.

How do I use it?
================

Look at the sample project. Hope it makes sense :)
